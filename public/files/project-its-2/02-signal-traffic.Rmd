# Project 1: Signalized Traffic

The main objective of this project is to design *traffic light signal* controls in order to optimize particular traffic conditions. Traffic signals regularly pre-establish fixed values *red* or *green* for a particular intersection. In fact the behavior can be modeled as: 

(ref:tlight) Traffic light signal example. 

```{r tlight, fig.cap='(ref:tlight)', fig.align = 'center', fig.width = 3.5, fig.asp= 0.7, echo= FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
N <- 1 # samples 
x <- c(seq(from = 1,  to = 30,  by = N),
       seq(from = 30, to =  60,  by = N),
       seq(from = 60, to =  90,  by = N),
       seq(from = 90, to =  120, by = N))
y <- c(rep(0, 30), rep(1, 31),rep(0, 31), rep(1, 31))
df <- data.frame(c(list(x),list(y)))
names(df) <- c("Time", "Light")
ggplot(data=df,aes(x=Time,y=Light))+geom_path() + 
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept=mean(Light)), color = "Red") + 
  labs(x='Time (s)', y = 'Light (Green/Red)')
```


The relationship between the switched green/red time in a traffic light can be represented by a pulse signal (Figure \@ref(fig:tlight)). The red line in the figure represents the *duty cycle* which represents the fraction of time the light was in green ($1$) with respect to the total cycle time ($60s$). In this case, the main objective is to study traffic models that can model signalized intersections and design control laws to design.

## Objectives {-}

The main objective of this project is to: 

1. Study the fundamental aspects of traffic signal control strategies. 
2. Obtain and simulate a macroscopic traffic model for a urban network with traffic signals 
3. Create and design control strategies applied via traffic signals in urban traffic networks. 
4. Compare the behavior of fixed time traffic signal polices and dynamic time traffic signal polices.
