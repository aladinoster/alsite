However, one prominent challenge for the successful implementation of truck platooning is the safe and efficient interaction with surrounding traffic, especially at network discontinuities where mandatory lane changes may lead to the decoupling of truck platoons. This contribution puts forward an efficient method for splitting a platoon of vehicles near network merges. A model-based bi-level control strategy is proposed. A supervisory tactical strategy based on a first-order car-following model with bounded acceleration is designed to maximize the flow at merge discontinuities. The decisions taken at this level include optimal vehicle order after the merge, new equilibrium gaps of automated trucks at the merging point, and anticipation horizon that the platoon members start to track the new equilibrium gaps. The lower-level operational layer uses a third-order longitudinal dynamics model to compute the optimal truck accelerations so that new equilibrium gaps have been created when merging vehicles start to change lane and the transient maneuvers are efficient, safe and comfortable. The tactical decisions are derived from an analytic car-following model and the operational accelerations are controlled via model predictive control with guaranteed stability. Simulation experiments are provided in order to test the feasibility and demonstrate the performance and robustness of the proposed strategy.","tags":["Truck Platooning","Connected \u0026 Automated Vehicles","Vehicle Merging"],"title":"A Hierarchical Approach For Splitting Truck Platoons Near Network Discontinuities","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Basic usage Coming soon\u0026hellip;\n","date":1543359600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543359600,"objectID":"a37f5318a8f9b15788e7d2467fae24e2","permalink":"/tutorial/simupy/","publishdate":"2018-11-28T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/simupy/","section":"tutorial","summary":"Basic usage Coming soon\u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"SymuPy","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" ITS for Smart Mobility See more about the projects here\nPlease find the slides at:\n Part I: Slides Estimation Part II: Slides Control Part III: Slides Platooning    Context Traffic congestion on urban roads is a problem of great interest nowadays since it strongly affects security and pollution.

They objective is to study to a certain level of detail some of the new traffic management systems that will conduct new ways of transportation in the XXI century. The general idea is based on the fact that information collected by sensors within traffic networks or in-vehicles sensors can collect information regarding the traffic condition, perform estimation of unknown traffic states and decide on specific actions to modify this state.\nProjects Specially, in this case the project will be focused in three main activities:\n Trafic signal design: This projects aims to study how to optimally deal with the design of light cycles to optimize the traffic performance. Based on information collected by infrastructure based sensors the traffic state can be determined and specific decisions in terms on green/red light times can be dynamically adapted. Vehicle Platooning: New in-vechicle sensors create situations in which vehicles may exchange information to improve traffic conditions. This project aims to study control algorithms implemented in the V2V (Vehicle-vehicle) communication layer that can be used to design traffic decisions. Density reconstruction: Sensors installed in traffic infrastructures provide information regarding the traffic state. Nevertheless the solution is not scalable to cover large cities due to the economical leverage required to deploy this technology. Algorithms to reconstruct traffic information may provide a promising future for accurately determine the traffic state of a city.

The traffic net- work is modeled within the framework of macroscopic traffic models, where we adopt Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model (LWR) conservation equation characterized by a piecewise linear fundamental diagram. The estimation problem considers two key principles. First, the error minimization between the measured and reconstructed flows and densities, and second the equilibrium state of the network which establishes flow propagation within the network. Both principles are integrated together with the traffic model constraints established by the supply/demand paradigm. Finally the problem is casted as a constrained quadratic optimization with equality constraints in order to shrink the feasible region of estimated variables. Some simulation scenarios based on synthetic data for a manhattan grid network are provided in order to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm.","tags":["Traffic Estimation","Sensor Fusion"],"title":"Density and flow reconstruction in urban traffic networks using heterogeneous data sources","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ladino A.","Kibangou A.","Canudas-de-Wit C.","Fourati H."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1506808800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1506808800,"objectID":"0e25f3b37e4c85499f9ab0e6962195bf","permalink":"/publication/tr-c-17/","publishdate":"2017-10-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/tr-c-17/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper addresses the problem of dynamic travel time (DTT) forecasting within highway traffic networks using speed measurements.

The system is written as a switched system. A state feedback is then computed for each mode using predictive control. It is shown that a nonlinear optimization problem can be formulated in order to obtain a control law which gives the best approximation of the state feedback control previously computed for each mode. This formulation ensures stability since stabilization conditions are also included through a common Lyapunov function. The optimization problem is then transformed to a problem with Bilinear Matrix Inequalities (BMI) constraints whose solution can be easily computed. Several examples show the feasibility and the efficiency of the approach.","tags":["Switched Systems","Predictive Control","Delayed Systems"],"title":"On the stability of predictive controllers for linear systems with variable time delays","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
